# glyphs-scripts
Scripts for Glyphs. Beware: Some of these script currently only work on Glyphs 2 and are experimentally being updated for Glyphs 3. Use at your own risk. Apologies for broken stuff.

## Kern On
### Copy models to small caps
Copies uppercase models to smallcaps. Support for copying number to small figures etc. in development.
### Set Base Models
Sets a pre-defined (but editable) list of kerning pairs as zero models for Kern On. Allows for capital kerning and per-master settings.

## Auto-Name Instances
Names instances based on assigned names. Useful for batch-renaming large families. Allows defining of naming exceptions for width classes.

## Batch Export
Opens a dialogue to choose multiple export formats. Sorts exported files into respective sub-directories (/Desktop/TTF, /Web/WOFF2, ...).

## Delete Duplicate Nodes
Checks for duplicate nodes (for instance after converting quadratic curves to cubic) and deletes these.

## Instance Kerner (WIP, one axis only)
Adds Replace Feature custom parameter for every instance for kerning. Useful for hard-coded capital/sc spacing. Currently only works for single-axis setups, still trying to figure out how to make this work for multiple axes. Todo: more than two kerning values per axis

## Interpolate Anchors
Same as clicking Re-Interpolate in the layers panel, but only affects anchors.

## Interpolate Letterspacer
Calculates paramArea, paramDepth and paramOver values for other masters based on two source masters. Currently only works for single-axis setups, please get in touch if you want to suggest a clean way of making it work for multiple axes! :)

## Interpolation Preview
Allows for visual interpolation, in order to add the interpolation as an instance or an intermediate layer. Respects multi-axis design spaces. Adding as an instance is still wobbly for Glyphs 3.

## Kern Slider
A simple tool to kern with a slider instead of using keyboard shortcuts.

## Make Smooth Nodes
Finds nodes that are not set to smooth that should be smooth. Useful for cleaning up client projects when they donâ€™t know how to draw properly.

## Make Web Weights
Converts master and instance weight values into USWeightClass values based on naming. Calculates AVAR table for correct interpolation. Takes care of intermediate layer values as well.

## Write AVAR
Writes an AVAR table based on stem weights. Affects only weight, regardless of axis count.
